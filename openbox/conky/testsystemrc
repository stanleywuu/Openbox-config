# This type of expression will display the output of a command:
# ${exec command}
# I've used it with a script and with a direct command.

# IMPORTANT: Extra line feeds after the text (i.e., blank lines) will
# make the blank background extend further down. In contrast, extra
# spaces at the end of the line will NOT make the blank background
# extend further to the right -
# "minimum_size" and "maximum_width" can do that.
